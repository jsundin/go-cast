# go-cast

Small util to publish a portion of the screen to a webserver. Useful for tracking progress updates on tasks that are not easily scriptable.

This was meant only as a small util for tracking misc tasks at home without having to run between rooms, and is **completely insecure** and unfit for use anywhere.
